I’m currently pursuing a [Master of Computer Science](https://cs.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), and I previously graduated from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/).

I’ve worked at Advantech and QuantaVision as an Application Engineer and SWE Intern — where I learned to become a *versatile engineer*, building 0→1 things that are nearly impossible to measure but incredibly satisfying to create.  
I love that messy, unquantifiable 0→1 phase — testing ideas, breaking things, fixing them, and calling it *“experimentation.”*

### Currently
- Grinding LeetCode (and occasionally LeetCrying) or 
- Working on a repo that will *definitely* work after one more commit or
- Paddling in the pool pretending I’m a seal discovering recursion or
- Lying on my bed, spinning existentially like a hamster on a wheel 

### Portfolio
My [Portfolio Website](https://chao-dotcom.github.io/) is a few commits behind my GitHub repo,  
but it features a beautiful cover photo taken at **SUMMIT One Vanderbilt** in NYC.


### Note
If you see a mysterious collaborator named `ch218-collab` — that’s also me.  
She has nobly sacrificed her bio to eternally prove our shared identity.
